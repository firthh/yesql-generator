# yesql-generator

Creates sql script for basic CRUD operations for a database. The SQL script is intended for use with YeSQL.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[yesql-generator "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[yesql-generator "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein yesql-generator
